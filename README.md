# Blots Language Support

This extension adds support for the [Blots](https://blots-lang.org) programming language to VSCode and other VSCode-based editors (such as Cursor).

Currently, this support consists of basic syntax highlighting.

## Install

This extension is available on both the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Blots.blots-syntax) and the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/blots/blots-syntax). You should be able to install it from within your editor like other extensions, but you can also download the VSIX file directly from either directory.
